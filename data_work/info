Important: -

- The 'data_clear.py' clears the data of some of the characters like ',', '.', '?', ';', etc.
- The 'data_clear.py' file produces the cleared text file.


- The 'data_extract.py' file extracts distinct words into a list and indexes them using a dictionary called 'word2ind'.
- It produces a pickle file in the data folder storing the list and word2ind, whole as a dictionary (more info given in the data folder).
